<title>
[tiny] Mutable is part of a lambda-declarator, so when a lambda is mutable, the parentheses aren't optional

<p>
It has been reported that various people have noticed that it's possible to write</p>
<pre>
<code>
auto lambda = []{};
</code>
</pre>
<p>but not</p>
<pre>
<code>
auto lambda2 = [] mutable {};
</code>
</pre>
<p>
In the mutable case, parentheses are required, thus:
</p>
<pre>
<code>
auto lambda3 = []() mutable {};
</code>
</pre>
<p>
The proposed consistency fix is to change the grammar to allow omitting the parentheses
for mutable lambdas as well.
</p>
<p>
An additional question EWG needs to decide is whether the empty parentheses
could be omitted for other cases besides mutable, such as</p>
<p>
<pre>
<code>
[] -> float {return 42;};
[] noexcept {foo();};
</code>
</pre>
</p>
