Portland 2012:
<p>Straw polls:</p>
<p>return as in the proposal: SF: 3 F: 2 N: 2 A: 4 SA: 5</p>
<p>arguments as in the proposal: SF: 2 F: 2 N: 1 A: 4 SA: 7</p>
<p>= {} vs. {} as in the proposal: SF: 2 F: 0 N: 4 A: 4 SA: 5</p>
<p>The author interprets these as dead, and does not plan to pursue this further.</p>
</p>
<p>
Sutter reopened the issue in [c++std-ext-14770], Lavavej and Voutilainen
reiterated reasons why the proposal was originally rejected. Sutter has
indicated that he wishes to create a revised paper focusing on the return
part, this issue is for him to reference in the paper.
