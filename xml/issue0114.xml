Portland 2012:
<p>Straw polls:</p>
<p>return as in the proposal: SF: 3 F: 2 N: 2 A: 4 SA: 5</p>
<p>arguments as in the proposal: SF: 2 F: 2 N: 1 A: 4 SA: 7</p>
<p>= {} vs. {} as in the proposal: SF: 2 F: 0 N: 4 A: 4 SA: 5</p>
<p>The author interprets these as dead, and does not plan to pursue this further.</p>
</p>
<p>
Sutter reopened the issue in [c++std-ext-14770], Lavavej and Voutilainen
reiterated reasons why the proposal was originally rejected. Sutter has
indicated that he wishes to create a revised paper focusing on the return
part, this issue is for him to reference in the paper.

Hinnant pointed to <a href="http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/HowardHinnant/papers/blob/master/return_direct.html">his response writeup</a> in [c++std-ext-14883], and it was noted that [c++std-lib-34985] is also related, and mentions <a href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2013/n3739.html">a paper by Kr&uuml;gler</a> that would solve some of the library issues
without introducing the problems Hinnant writes about.
</p>
<p>
Dimov presented a different incarnation of some of these problems in
[c++std-lib-36408] "map&lt;K,V>::emplace and explicit V constructors", and
Kr&uuml;gler pointed out his paper solves that issue as well.
