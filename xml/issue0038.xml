In Portland, CWG categorized a number of issues as "extension," which
I presume you
will automatically look at for potential EWG involvement once the new
revision of the
issues list is out.  I did want to mention one issue for which we will
be resolving part
and referring the other part to EWG: issue 1542 raises the question of
whether the
narrowing rules make sense for a compound assignment, e.g.,
<pre>
    char c;
    c += {1};
</pre>
CWG addressed a similar issue (1078) for an ordinary assignment and
decided that,
although the narrowing error was annoying in that case, it wasn't
worth the effort to
change the language because the workaround was simply to add a cast.  In this
case, however, there's no way to avoid the error (no place to put the
cast).  I think we'd
be happy with a revision of the narrowing rules that addressed both
this case and the
one in 1078; maybe the answer is just "why would you use the { } form
in a case like
this anyway?"

In Bristol 2013: EWG thinks the answer _is_ just "why would you use the { } form in a case like this anyway?". NAD.
