<p>
In c++std-core-14770, Dos Reis suggests that operator[] and
operator() should both be allowed to be static. In addition
to that, he suggests that both should allow multiple parameters.
It's well known that there's a possibility that this breaks
existing code (foo[1,2] is valid, the thing in brackets
is a comma-expression) but there are possibilities to fix
such cases (by requiring parens if a comma-expression
is desired). EWG should discuss whether such unification
is to be strived for.
</p>
<p>Discussed in Rapperswil 2014. EWG points out that there are more issues to consider here, in terms of other operators, motivations, connections with captureless lambdas, who knows what else, so an analysis paper is requested.
