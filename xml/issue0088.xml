<p>
In c++std-core-14770, Dos Reis suggests that operator[] and
operator() should both be allowed to be static. In addition
to that, he suggests that both should allow multiple parameters.
It's well known that there's a possibility that this breaks
existing code (foo[1,2] is valid, the thing in brackets
is a comma-expression) but there are possibilities to fix
such cases (by requiring parens if a comma-expression
is desired). EWG should discuss whether such unification
is to be strived for.
