Bristol 2013: Van Winkel pointed out that this allows jumping out of nested 
loops. Naumann expressed doubt over whether the problem is so big that we 
need such a big extension to solve it. Van Winkel and Spertus thought that 
this would likely be a popular feature. Voutilainen thought that it would be 
beneficial to revisit a lambda solution. Talbot expressed doubt whether that's 
a suitable solution, syntax-wise and performance-wise. Austern thought that 
this seems to be in flux, and thought we aren't necessarily ready to choose 
between the various options. Gottschling thought Vandevoorde's option is 
nice, since it's still structured. Spertus said he likes the idea of having 
a control structure be an expression. Austern recommended looking closely 
at Clause 5 in the follow-up paper.
