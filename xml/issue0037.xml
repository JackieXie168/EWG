I have a low-priority issue for adding the (neglected) logical-xor operator, ^^.
This has traditionally been dismissed as un-necessary, as it is equivalent to boolean operator!=, and there is no short-circuiting benefit to justify adding it.

However, contextual conversions to 'bool' are handled specially for logical operators, and in that context it would be completing a hole in the language.

I wish I had a better example, but pulling from the standard library:
<pre>
   function&lt;void()&gt; a;
   function&lt;void()&gt; b;
   assert(a != b);  // does not compile
   assert(a ^^ b);  // would compile, and assert!
</pre>
</p>

Bristol 2013: EWG doesn't believe reopening this discussion, it's been tried previously and it's unlikely that a new round would lead to anything. NAD.
