I had submitted a DR (727) about this in October 2008 - and it was
classified as an extension - I wonder if Spertus' DR (1077) that was
also classified as an extension should be considered along with this
one.


14.7.3 [temp.expl.spec] paragraph 2 requires that explicit
specializations of member templates be declared in namespace scope,
not in the class definition. This restriction does not apply to
partial specializations of member templates; that is,
<pre>
    struct A {
      template&lt;class T&gt; struct B;
      template &lt;class T&gt; struct B&lt;T*&gt; { }; // well-formed
      template &lt;&gt; struct B&lt;int*&gt; { }; // ill-formed
    };
</pre>
There does not seem to be a good reason for this inconsistency.
