In 20.4.1p2, the unspecialized std::tuple_size is undefined.  It would be a lot more useful if it were defined as an empty struct; that way, it can be used with enable_if for determining whether or not it is valid to use tuple_size, tuple_element and get on the corresponding data structure.

This should go to LEWG.
