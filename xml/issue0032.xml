struct Silly
{
    template&lt;class... Ts&gt;
    Silly(Ts&amp;&amp;...)
    {}
};

int main()
{
    Silly s;
    Silly t(s);	// Silly::Silly(Ts &amp;&amp;...) [Ts = &lt;Silly &amp;&gt;]
    const Silly u;
    Silly v(u); // calls Silly::Silly(Silly const&amp;)
}
</pre>

The problem is that users expect the copy constructor to be called in both situations.

Note:  you do not need variadics for this; it made the example smaller.  Also, this issue existed in C++03, but rarely happened in practice because templated parameters were usually declared const T&amp;.

Bristol 2013: Sutton and Gregor proposed various work-arounds, like additional overloads and constraints. Stroustrup asked whether having a copying template have different semantics from a copy constructor isn't an error, and Gregor explained that tuples run into that issue and they have different semantics for the template. The submitter is encouraged to write a paper, and practical examples are desirable.
