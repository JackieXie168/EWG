Bristol 2013: Maurer expressed surprise at the paper being under discussion, and explained that he doesn't think it can be made to work under current linker environments, and further explained that user-defined equality operators cause confusion and surprises. Maurer said that he'd want Stroustrup to clarify which parts of the paper he would want.
