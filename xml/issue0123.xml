<p>
The paper contains the proposed wording.
</p>
</resolution>
<p>Discussed in Rapperswil 2014.</p>
<p>EWG was unanimously against having an operator for this, and recommended
taking the idea up with the Numerics SG and then with LWG. Closing as resolved,
Vandevoorde sent a heads-up to the Numerics reflector.</p>
