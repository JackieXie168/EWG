See <a href="http://open-std.org/JTC1/SC22/WG21/docs/cwg_toc.html#1564">Core issue 1564</a>.
</p>
<p>Discussed in Rapperswil 2014. EWG points out that auto deduction is moving
to the opposite direction, and there's a reason why the suggested deduction
isn't done, Vandevoorde showed an example of an overload set including
an unconstrained template and a function taking a vector, and explained that 
the rules currently choose the function taking a vector, and advised against
changing that. Closing as NAD.</p>
