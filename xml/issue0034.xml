<p>
We have a hash function for built-in types and for some standard library types, but we don't have automatically generated hash&lt;&gt; specializations for user-defined types like
<pre>
  struct my_type {
    int x;
    std::string y;
    vector&lt;int&gt; z;
  };
</pre>
Defining a good and efficient hash function for composite types takes a fair amount of work. One consequence is that there are a lot of user-defined types with bad hash functions floating around.

One possibility is automatically generating hash&lt;&gt; specializations, but that's tricky. A simpler possibility is providing tools that make it easier for users to do the right thing.
