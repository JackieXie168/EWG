Issaquah 2014: EWG discussed the paper, and found preference towards
option 3, which allows implementations to use useful messages, but
doesn't force them to document what they provide, so it was
seen superior to the other alternatives. The proposal is expected
to go forward to Core, and it has wording already.

Adopted into the working draft in Urbana,as N3928.
