There are lots of very basic manipulations that are either really hard
or impossible to do with argument packs unless you use something that
causes a big recursive template instantiation, which is expensive at
compile-time and can cause bad error messages.  I want to be able to
index argument packs with integral constant expressions, "take" or
"drop" the first N elements of the pack, etc.
