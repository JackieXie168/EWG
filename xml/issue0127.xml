<p>Discussed in Rapperswil 2014</p>
<p>Straw poll: should we encourage Sutter to go ahead:</p>
<p> SF 10 F 8 N 3 A 3 SA 3</p>
<p>Sutter asked the reason for the votes against, Gregor expressed
doubt on whether the approach is feasible with regards to the amount
of work, Carruth expressed doubt on having two slightly different
standard libraries.</p>
<p>Stra poll: language ABI:</p>
<p>SF 12 F 14 N 0 A 1 SA 0</p>

and Sutter expressed interest in continuing to work on the idea.</p>
