<p>
As more variadic functions work their way into my C++ code, I'm getting increasingly annoyed that there isn't a variadic bind.

There is a tiny bit of annoyance on exactly what to use. There seems to me to be 2 sensible choices (other people may have others)

<pre>
  1) _args : Use all otherwise unnamed arguments.
  2) _3onwards : All arguments from the 3rd onwards.
</pre>

I haven't personally found a need for multiple ranges of variadic arguments, or more complicated chopping (such as getting the last few arguments), and I'd want to hopefully keep this simple if possible!
