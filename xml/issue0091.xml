See <a href="http://open-std.org/JTC1/SC22/WG21/docs/cwg_toc.html#622">Core issue 622</a>.
</p>
<p>
Discussed in Rapperswil 2014. EWG finds that there's a preference for defining this, but some architectures have separate memory spaces for data/code/constants, it's non-trivial to define.</p>
<p>
Closing as NAD. If someone wants to argue that the results of such
pointer comparisons should be implementation-defined, papers are welcome.
