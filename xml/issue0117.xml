<p>
Discussed in Rapperswil 2014. A fairly long discussion, with lots of
concerns about the motivation.
</p>
<p>Straw polls:</p>
<p>Proposal as stated:</p>
<p> SF 1 - WF 1 - N 2 - WA 8 - SA 15</p> 
<p>Just the virtual parts, in a new paper:</p> 
<p>SF 4 - WF 3 - N 5 - WA 6 - SA 7</p>
<p>Virtual parts and some others:</p>
<p> SF 1 - WF 4 - N 1 - WA 9 - SA 10</p>
<p>We're done for this meeting. We don't actually encourage this proposal to come back, but there are people who'd like improvements for virtual functions. </p>
<p>Closing as NAD, no consensus to adopt.</p>
</discussion>
<resolution>
The paper contains the proposed wording.
