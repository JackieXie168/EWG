See <a href="http://open-std.org/JTC1/SC22/WG21/docs/cwg_toc.html#1798">Core Issue 1798</a>
</p>
<p>
Discussed in Rapperswil 2014. EWG previously decided that exception
specifications should not become part of the type system. On this
issue, EWG thought that the exception specification in a template
parameter is effectively ignored, and that's fine. Closing as NAD 
for now, if this should be reopened, a paper should be written
to consider the impact of any suggested change.
