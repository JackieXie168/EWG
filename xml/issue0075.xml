Discussed in Chicago 2013: 

<p>    Poll 4: Conservative approach. SF 3 - 2 - 5 - 0 - 0 SA </p>
<p>    Poll 5: Aggressive approach: SF 6 - 1 - 3 - 0 - 0 SA </p>
<p>    Poll 6: Support both, with different attributes. SF 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 - 0 SA </p>

<p>
Vandevoorde expressed that he likes the idea of having two attributes,
one for memoizing and the other for non-side-effecting. Stroustrup and
Spertus expressed concern about multiple attributes being confusing.
Stroustrup gave his guidance to have a two-part proposal with both
the "aggressive" mode and the more conservative mode. Vandevoorde
promised his assistance for writing the wording.
