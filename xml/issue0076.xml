Reviewed in Chicago 2013. Stroustrup recommended looking into Vandevoorde's 
solution of doing a type manipulation instead of running code in a conversion 
since there doesn't seem to a palatable reason for running code, and thought 
that the solution should be simplified, and it should be much better than 
what you can hack today. The author is encouraged to pursue the idea further.
