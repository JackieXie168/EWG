See <a href="http://open-std.org/JTC1/SC22/WG21/docs/cwg_toc.html#1272">Core issue 1272</a>.
</p>
<p>
Discussed in Rapperswil 2014. Vandevoorde pointed out that there are
backwards compatibility issues, Dennett pointed out that the proposed
resolution makes the language more irregular and less teachable. Closing
as NAD.
