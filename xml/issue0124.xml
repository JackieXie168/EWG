<p>Discussed in Rapperswil 2014.</p>
<p>
Voutilainen pointed out that it seems important to be able to express 
whether explicit operations are ok or not. Vandevoorde said there's a 
difference between conversions and initializations. Dennett pointed out that 
this proposal clashes with the direction of N3912, and showed an example 
of the different directions; N3912 makes copy vs. direct initialization 
more significant with auto, whereas the Josuttis proposal makes it less 
significant. Josuttis in addition mentioned that it's unfortunate that we 
have no guidelines for when to use explicit and when not, and that makes 
things difficult for the library.

<p>Straw poll, accept the proposal:</p>
<p>SF: 1 F: 2 N: 6 A: 8 SA: 1</p>
<p>No consensus to adopt, closing as NAD.</p>
